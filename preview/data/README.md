## Touchscreen frontend
Self-contained package served from a locally-run webserver on each touchscreen. All content is packaged and pushed to an [AWS S3 bucket](http://touchscreen-archives.calacademy.org) by the CMS. AVEE runs a system to scrape for fresh content packages and install as-needed on a daily schedule. 

The web preview for content editors is accessed over the internet, e.g.
